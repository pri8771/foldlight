## Pre-Development Known Risks (Tracked as Potential Bugs)

| Risk ID | Area | Description | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---------|------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| RISK-001 | Fold Engine | Board state corruption if fold applied during animation | Medium | Lock board state during animation transition |
| RISK-002 | Fold Engine | Infinite loop in reverse-construction generator | Low | Add iteration cap + fallback to pre-validated puzzles |
| RISK-003 | SpriteKit | Memory spike when loading large biome atlas | Medium | Use on-demand asset loading + texture atlas paging |
| RISK-004 | StoreKit 2 | Transaction not finalized if app crashes mid-purchase | Low | Always check unfinished transactions on app launch |
| RISK-005 | SwiftData | Migration failure on model version change | Medium | Strict versioned migration plan before any model changes |
| RISK-006 | Performance | 60fps drop on older devices (iPhone 12) during fold animation | Medium | Reduce particle count + use lower-res textures on A14 and below |
| RISK-007 | Game Center | Leaderboard submission failure during offline play | High | Queue failed submissions, retry on next connection |
| RISK-008 | IAP | Duplicate purchase charged if network timeout | Low | StoreKit 2 handles idempotency, but verify with sandbox testing |
| RISK-009 | Puzzle Gen | Difficulty curve not matching intended progression | Medium | Playtest each biome independently, adjust classifier thresholds |
| RISK-010 | Audio | ASMR sounds not playing when device on silent | Low | Use AVAudioSession with .ambient category to bypass silent mode |

## Bug History Log

| Date | Action | Bug ID | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| 2026-06-27 | Created bug tracker | — | Initial setup |
| 2026-06-28 | Foundation implemented (FOLDLIGHT-PROMPT-001) | — | App shell, navigation, services, persistence, design system + unit tests added. No defects found during implementation review. |
| 2026-06-28 | Core fold engine implemented (FOLDLIGHT-PROMPT-002) | — | Board/fold/combination/beam models + solver + undo/reset + 6 test files. No defects found; engine is Foundation-only and deterministic. |

## Known Limitations (Foundation Phase — not defects)

These are intentional, documented gaps from the Phase 1 foundation, tracked so they
are not mistaken for bugs. None are P0/P1.

| Ref | Area | Limitation | Planned Resolution |
|-----|------|-----------|--------------------|
| LIM-001 | Build verification | Foundation was authored in a Linux container without Xcode; the iOS build & `swift test` were not executed in-session. | Run `xcodebuild`/tests on a macOS host (first task of next phase). |
| LIM-002 | Persistence | MVP uses Codable file storage + UserDefaults instead of SwiftData (per Phase 1 prompt). | Swap behind `SaveService` protocol in a later phase (tracker T002-05). |
| LIM-003 | Audio | `AudioService` is a documented stub (configures the session, no samples). | Wire ASMR/music assets in E010. |
| LIM-004 | App icon | Placeholder 1024px icon slot, no artwork. | Produce icon set in E010 (tracker T002-03). |
| LIM-005 | Play screen | Lightweight SwiftUI engine demo (fold/undo/reset on a sample puzzle). The polished SpriteKit board with free fold gestures is not yet built. | SpriteKit board (Phase 3). |
| LIM-006 | Hint engine | A general solver-based "next best fold" hint (T004-06) is not implemented; the Play demo uses a known sample solution. | Implement search-based hint engine (Phase 6). |
| LIM-007 | Geometric unfold | `FoldEngine.unfold()` (reverse-construction primitive) is deferred; undo uses board snapshots instead. | Add for the procedural generator (Phase 4). |
